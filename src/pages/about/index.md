Hi! 

My name is Liu Liang Yin.

I studied Product Design and graduated from NTNU 1 year ago, and now working as an UI/UX  Designer in Taipei. Design is always interesting. And I believe that design can solve problems and improve human life! 

This website is a collection of my works during 2016-2018.

Thanks for watching!

Here is my [CV](https://liuliangyin.com/img/liuliangyin_resume_2018.pdf).
