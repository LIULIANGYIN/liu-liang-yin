Hi! My name is Liu Liang Yin.

I studied Product Design and graduated from NTNU 1 year ago, and now working as an UI/UX  Designer in Taipei. I make interactive website and application interface. With my background of product design, I am perceptive and detail-minded when thinking about product experience. I believe that design can solve problems, and looking forwards to bringing ideas to life!

This website is a collection of my works during 2016-2018. Thanks for watching!
